List of things riba needs to clear out before next official in order
of importance:
(Keep Getty happy)

- Figure out what fundamental leak (or group of leaks) is present in the
  DBICTest::LeakTrace implementation itself
- Figure out why none of them show up as failures (ton of false negatives)
- Clarify/warn on the distinct over multiple columns get_column()
- Incompatibly move around pieces of BlockRunner (critical - people are
  starting to rely on it)
